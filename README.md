# Deployment notes

1. Check that all the values in the `.env.example` file are correctly set in the environment.
2. Edit how an environment affects Strapi configuration in the corresponding files
   1. `./config/[configFile].js` set the default configuration
   2. `./config/env/production/[configFile.js` override the default configuration for the production environment (`NODE_ENV` environment variable)
3. Don't forget to install dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Build the application: `yarn build`
5. Launch: `yarn start`
